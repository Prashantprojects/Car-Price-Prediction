# Car-Price-Prediction

How does on actually predict a second hand car price? There are several attributes that can be considerd such as the number of years, fuel type, kms and so on. In this project i will create a Machine Learning Model which predicts Car Price based on its specifications.

The below Machine Learning Models have been applied:

Linear Regression (accuracy: 89.93%)
Decision Trees (accuracy: 87.90%)
Random Forest (accuracy: 88.89%)
Ada Boost (accuracy: 87.86%)
XGBoost (accuracy: 90.30%)
KNN (accuracy: 87.39%)
SVM (accuracy: 77.91%)
The project consist of the following steps:

Reading the data in python
Defining the problem statement
Identifying the Target variable
Looking at the distribution of Target variable
Basic Data exploration
Rejecting useless columns
Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)
Feature Selection based on data distribution
Outlier treatment
Missing Values treatment
Visual correlation analysis
Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)
Converting data to numeric for ML
Sampling and K-fold cross validation
Trying multiple Regression algorithms
Selecting the best Model
Deploying the best model in production
